# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using pnpm
- Package added to dependencies in `package.json`
- Lock files updated: `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### 2. Code Changes
**Modified: `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after `<SpeedInsights />` within the `NextIntlClientProvider`

## Implementation Details

The project uses the App Router architecture with a locale-based layout structure. The Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`, which ensures analytics tracking is enabled across all pages of the application for both supported locales (en, pt).

The component placement follows best practices:
- Inside the `<body>` tag
- After the main application content ({children})
- Alongside the existing SpeedInsights component
- Within the NextIntlClientProvider context

## Verification

- ✓ Linting: No new errors introduced in the modified file
- ✓ TypeScript: The Analytics component import and usage are type-safe
- ✓ Package verification: @vercel/analytics@1.6.1 successfully installed with correct exports

Note: The build command failed due to pre-existing Supabase authentication configuration issues unrelated to these Analytics changes. The specific file modified (layout.tsx) passes all linting checks without errors.

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated with new dependency tree
- `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
